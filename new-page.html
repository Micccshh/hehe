      Dear Micah,<br><br>
      I hope this letter finds you well and surrounded by love and happiness. I have been thinking about you a lot lately and wanted to take a moment to express the depth of my love for you.<br><br>
      From the moment I met you, I was struck by your kind and caring nature. Your warm smile and gentle words always bring a light to any room you walk into. Your infectious laughter and beautiful smile are like a ray of sunshine on even the darkest of days. I was immediately drawn to your beautiful personality and I knew from that moment that you were someone special.<br><br>
      As I have gotten to know you better, I have come to appreciate all of the amazing qualities that make you who you are. Your intelligence, sense of humor, and unwavering compassion never cease to amaze me. You have a heart of gold and I am constantly in awe of your ability to make those around you feel special and loved. You are my girlfriend and my best friend, and I am grateful to have you in my life.<br><br>
      Every day, I am reminded of how lucky I am to have you by my side. Whether it's through the gifts you give me, the comforting words you share when I need them, or the countless little gestures you make to make my day brighter, you always show me how much you care. I cherish each and every moment that I spend with you and I am so grateful for your love and support. You have become my rock and my safe haven, and I cannot imagine going through life without you.<br><br>
      I want to spend the rest of my life cherishing and loving you. You bring so much joy and happiness into my life and I cannot imagine a future without you by my side. I promise to always be there for you, through the good times and the bad, and to support you in all of your dreams and aspirations. I will always strive to make you feel loved and appreciated, and I will spend each and every day showing you just how much you mean to me.<br><br>
      So, I must ask: will you be my Valentine? I promise to spend each and every day showing you how much you mean to me and how grateful I am to have you in my life. I want to spend the rest of my life making you smile and filling your days with love and happiness.<br><br>
      Yours always,<br>
      Carl
